- Programming Language : Python
- Frameworks/Libraries : Dash and Plotly

Note: This project is also deployed on AWS EC2 instance. Cloud Deployment steps are mentioned in subsequent section of this file.

The market for used cars is increasing tremendously these days. Hence, there is a need for a prediction system that tells the price of a used car using a variety of features. This model will help buyers as well as sellers in quoting honest price for their vehicle.

# Dataset ðŸ“Š
### Source: Kaggle

The dataset used to implement this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data).
This dataset includes the record of every used vehicle within the United States. It includes details like the price of the vehicle, manufacturing company details, current vehicle condition, fuel type and 22 other columns which capture every detail of the vehicle.
